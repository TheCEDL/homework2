        Problem 1:

        1. Use TensorFlow to construct a 2-layer neural network as stochastic policy.
           The hidden layer should be fully-connected and have size `hidden_dim`.
           Use tanh as the activation function of the first hidden layer, and append softmax layer after the output
           of the neural network to get the probability of each possible action.

        2. Assign the output of the softmax layer to the variable `probs`.
           Let's assume n_batch equals to `self._observations.get_shape()[0]`,
           then shape of the variable `probs` should be [n_batch, n_actions].

        Sample solution is about 2~4 lines.
